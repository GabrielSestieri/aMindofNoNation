      <h2>Information Science?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p>A rather new, multidisciplanry major that approaches <br> tech from the human perspective</p></li>
        <li><p>Classes ranged from theoritical aspects of technology like the ethics of big data <br> 
          where we were taught how to evaluate major privacy and security questions raised by big data, IoT, wearables and other AI-driven systems.<br> 
          We covered history of research ethics and considered how ethical frameworks can and should be applied to digital data.</p></li>
        <li><p>To classes such as data base design where we learned how to build a database and query it using the SQL language and mySQL server;<br>
          we also cleaned, wrangled, and analyzed datasets with over 230,000 entries and 12 columns <br>
          using python and openrefine in various data analysis classes throughout the four years.</li>
        <li>I use the tools I was provided by my major everyday. But more than that, Information Science has taught me how to search for knowledge correctly and effeciently, which in my opinion is the most valuable tool.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Network+ and Security+ certified by the end of January and Febuary 2022, respectively. <br> eJPT after that, and OCSP as the final boss.</li>
        <li>Simulating real-world scenarios with my homelab. This includes:</li>
          <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>- Linking all current servers through GNS3, essentially creating a Local Area Network that accesses the internet through NAT </li>
            <li>- Installing a vulnerable virtual machine and attempt to root it before and after configuring a pfsense firewall.</li>
            <li>- Monitoring the SIEM logs hosted on a VM acting as a SIEM server while a Kali Linux VM attempts various scanning and enumerating inside and outside the LAN.</li>
            <li>- Continuing the confugiration of my Active Directory environment and then trying to exploit it.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Making my way towards working on a red team by strengthening my networking, enumerating, and scripting foundations.</li>

        <p>A project assigned to me and one other peer in our dynamic web development class. Using pure Javascript and 
            Google's map, geocoding, and distance matrix API, we created a crime tracker based on a dataset of our 
            county's crime. <br> <br> It has been greatly neglected and as a consequence looks like its from the 90s and to fit the bill also has many bugs</p>

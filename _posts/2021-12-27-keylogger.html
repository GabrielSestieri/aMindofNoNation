        <p>A simple Python based keylogger that uses pynput to record keystrokes and then store them in a raw and cleaned 
            file where the cleaned file has certain function keys (backspace, enter, etc) edited to represent their function.
            <br> <br> I plan to add a functionality that automatically sends the cleaned file to my email after a certain amount of time has passed.

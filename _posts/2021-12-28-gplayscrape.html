        <p>I was tasked with finding a way to scrape information on app developers published on Google Play based on specific keywords. 
            Fortunately I found a pip package that established a foundation that I could build upon.
            Using Selenium I continuously parse through the page until it reaches the last app available. 
            The program concurrently opens each app and scrapes the name of the app, the email of the developer, and the company or organization the developer belongs to and outputs it as a dataframe that is then converted to an Excel sheet that can be used for marketing purposes.
            <br> <br>I am planning on adding an automatic emailing functionality that could send a prebuilt email to each developer.

        <p>drug_interactions.py is a Python program that makes a series of calls to the National Library of Medicine's REST API. It then collects all interactions between two drugs. For example if a user inputs "Insulin" the program outputs a file called interactions.txt that stores all interactions between insulin and various other drugs:
            "0,"insulin, regular, human",leuprolide,The therapeutic efficacy of Insulin human can be decreased when used in combination with Leuprolide."

        <p>After the GooglePlay Scraper I was tasked with a LinkedIn bot that could automatically connect with a person based on 
            the searched keyword. It would then send a prebuilt personalized note to aid in the recruiting process. 
            <br> <br> This program runs only after providing the the GUI with a searchword.</p>
